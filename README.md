**SMAL (State Machine Abstraction Language)** is a compact, human‑readable YAML DSL for defining fully functional state machines that are:

- **Simple** — easy to write, easy to read  
- **Robust** — validated, structured, and type‑safe  
- **Debuggable** — designed for real firmware workflows  

A `.smal` file describes your entire state machine — states, events, transitions, commands, messages, and error handling — in a clean, declarative format. From that single source of truth, SMAL can generate:

- **C, C++, and Rust firmware code**
- **A complete SVG state machine diagram**
- **Debug structures** for introspection and tooling
- **Human-readable reports** for developers and QA

SMAL is built for embedded systems, audio devices, wearables, robotics, and any environment where clarity, determinism, and debuggability matter.

# ✨ Features

### 🧩 YAML-based DSL  
Define states, events, transitions, actions, etc. in a clean, expressive format.

### 🔧 Multi-language code generation  
Generate firmware-ready code in **C**. **C++** and **Rust** planned for future release.

### 🖼️ SVG diagram generation  
Produce a polished, auto‑layout state machine diagram directly from your `.smal` file.

### 🐞 Debug-friendly  
SMAL includes a structured debug layout that maps cleanly to firmware and tooling.

### 🛠️ Extensible  
Add custom generators, validators, or analysis tools.

# 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install smal-lang
```
