# 🚀 Overview

**SMAL (State Machine Abstraction Language)** is a compact, human‑readable YAML DSL for defining fully functional state machines that are:

- **Simple** — easy to write, easy to read  
- **Robust** — validated, structured, and type‑safe  
- **Debuggable** — designed for real firmware workflows  

A `.smal` file describes your entire state machine — states, events, transitions, commands, messages, and error handling — in a clean, declarative format. From that single source of truth, SMAL can generate:

- **C, C++, and Rust firmware code**
- **A complete SVG state machine diagram**
- **Debug structures** for introspection and tooling
- **Human-readable reports** for developers and QA

SMAL is built for embedded systems, audio devices, wearables, robotics, and any environment where clarity, determinism, and debuggability matter.
